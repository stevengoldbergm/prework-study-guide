# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is an exploration of the most basic foundations of Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created as a hands-on introduction to various topics, including Git commands, working with GitHub, web page structure, external style sheets, and basic JavaScript concepts. It provides a list of notes on each of the above topics, as well as a randomized topic selector which suggests what a student should study each time the web page is opened.

Over the course of building this web page, I learned the following:

- The basic syntax for writing documents in Markdown
- The basics of using Git Bash
- The basics of using GitHub and the developer workflow
- The basics of using VS Code
- The basic structure of an HTML webpage
- The basic structure of CSS, including the various style sheet types and how to connect them to HTML
- The basics of JavaScript, including Control flow, functions, recursive loops, and connecting scripts to HTML

## Usage

To use the Study Guide, simply review the notes in each section as needed. Additionally, there is a random topic selector viewable in the Chrome DevTools. This can be accessed by pressing ***Command+Options+I*** (MacOS), ***Control+Shift+I*** (Windows), or by right clicking the webpage and selecting "Inspect." Select the "Console" tab in the DevTools window to view both the topics learned during Prework, and the random suggested topic for study.
